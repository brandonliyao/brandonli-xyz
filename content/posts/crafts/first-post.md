#  Easy Crafts
## Steps 1 - 8(Craft 1):
On steps 1 - 8 we will make the awesome G-2!
* 1. First find a Pilot G-2 07 pen of any color.(Some other Pilot pen models may work, but I recommend the Pilot G-2 07.)
* 2. Next, deassemble the pen, you will not need the grip and the lower part that screws on.
* 3. Follow the order of pieces shown in picture 3 and push them in with the ink cartridge.
* 4. After you push it in, the result will look like picture 4.
* 5. Next, push the little piece shown in picture 5 until it clicks on the small ring in the barrel.
You have now completed a craft!
The G-2 can be reloaded by repeating step 6.
This craft has a fatal weakness, though, since it loses special ammunition every time.

## Steps 9 - 16(Craft 2):
On steps 9 - 16 we will make the legendary Buzz Shot!
* 1. To make the Buzz Shot you will need a deassembled BIC Round Stic pen or BIC Round Stic Grip pen (Xtra Life Ballpoint ones), 5 (1 for backup if another breaks) big rubber bands, and a binder clip.
* 2. First use the point of the pen to poke a hole through the cap, deassemble the pen, and throw away the turtleneck and ink or store it for another craft.
* 3. Now wrap the binder clip in rubber bands as shown in picture 11. (Make sure to add support at the back)
* 4. Push a rubber band through the hole in the cap, leaving an inch in front of the cap.
* 5. Push the cap on, still leaving about an inch.
* 6. Stick a thumbtack on the bottom, right next to the cap, as seen in picture 14.
* 7. Pull the rubber band back clip it in the binder clip as shown in picture 15, Put the butt cap in the loopof the binder clip and you're ready to shoot!

## Step 17 - 25(Craft 3):
* 1. We will now make the last project, the nubbuster! You will need a mechanical pencil, the spring of the G-2, and the clicker (The clicker is optional. You could use the eraser instead.)
* 2. Take off the cap of the mechanical pencil where the lead comes out, press the eraser, and you will see a white cap pop out with the bottom of the lead chamber.
* 3. Use scissors to cut the chamber, take it out, and cut it to the other color or thickness (Look at picture 20) Saw the top of the mechanical pencil like shown in every picture.
* 4. Shove the spring onto the chamber where you just cut it and put it in the barrel.
* 5. Pull the chamber back and press the clicker on the end. Press the chamber to fire!
